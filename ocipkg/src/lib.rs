//! ocipkg consists of executables (`ocipkg` and `cargo-ocipkg`) and this crate for handling OCI Artifact without container runtime.
//!
//! See [README.md at GitHub](https://github.com/termoshtt/ocipkg) for usage of the executables.
//! This reference describes the crate part.
//!
//! Layout, Manifest, and Artifact
//! -------------------------------
//! ocipkg defines original type of OCI Artifact, `application/vnd.ocipkg.v1.artifact` to exchange directories containing static libraries.
//! But this crate is also a general purpose library to handle any kind of OCI Artifact which can contain any kind of data.
//!
//! Note that current implementation (from ocipkg 0.3.0) is based on [OCI Image specification] 1.1.0.
//!
//! ### Image Manifest
//! Every contents in a container are stored as blob, and identified by its hash digest (usually SHA256 is used).
//! [OCI Image Manifest] describes how these blobs are combined to form a container.
//! From [OCI Image specification] 1.1.0, [OCI Image Manifest] can store OCI Artifact in addition to usual executable containers.
//!
//! In this crate, [oci_spec::image::ImageManifest] is used to represent [OCI Image Manifest].
//!
//! ### Image Layout
//! [OCI Image Layout] specifies how blobs are stored as a directory.
//! Blobs are stored in `blobs/sha256/` directory with its hash digest as a file name.
//! [OCI Image Manifest] is a JSON string and also stored as a blob, thus we have to find the blob storing the manifest first.
//! `index.json` lists the digests of manifests stored in the layout.
//! There is also a file `oci-layout` which contains version of the layout itself.
//!
//! Two types of layout formats are supported. `oci-dir` format is a directory containing blobs as [OCI Image Layout] format:
//!
//! ```text
//! {dirname}/
//! ├── blobs/
//! │   └── sha256/
//! │       ├── 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef
//! │       └── ...
//! ├── index.json
//! └── oci-layout
//! ```
//!
//! `oci-archive` format is a tar archive of a `oci-dir` format. Creating a new image layout takes following steps:
//!
//! 1. Create an empty layout
//! 2. Add blobs, and store their digests
//! 3. Create a manifest using blob digests, store the manifest itself as blob, and store its digest in `index.json`
//!
//! This process is abstracted by [image::ImageBuilder]. This yields a layout which implements [image::Image] trait.
